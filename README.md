Iâ€˜m Qiong Qin. I was a elementary teacher teaching mandarin for seversal year.

I started to learn coding since I watched TV show Silicon Valley. Back then I had no idea what the characters talked about: Java,Python,tech conference, hoodie with company's logo, ect, but I was fascinated about those concepts I did not undrstand and wanted to be one of them. 

I started to learn python myself for several months, it was not easy because nothing made sense in the beginning, even the task of writing a for loop to find a smallest number from a sequence took me half day to figure out.

Now I am studying computer science as a graduate student. Motivation, perservence and hard working dirve me to go far.
