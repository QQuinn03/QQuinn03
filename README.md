I started to learn coding since I watched TV show Silicon Valley. Back then I had no idea what the characters talked about: Java,Python,algorithm, ect, but I was fascinated about those concepts and wanted to be one of the coders: to wear hoodie with company's logo and code some thing productive. 

I started to learn python myself for several months. It was not easy because nothing made sense in the beginning, even the task of writing a for loop to find a smallest number from a sequence took me half day to figure out.

Now I am studying computer science as a graduate student. Motivation, perservence and hard working drive me to go far.
